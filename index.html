                <p>My current interests include design, fabrication, and validation of technologies and experiences with a focus on human interaction. I have experience in user-centered design through various academic and extracurricular projects and I have a track record of leading teams to create successful products. I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary projects that foster collaboration across fields.</p>
                <p>I am currently looking for opportunities to advance my skills in the biotech or attractions industries. I have previously interned at the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab, the top rehabilitation hospital in the country, as well as the Niles District Township for Special Education. These experiences allowed me to work closely with users, develop solutions to meet their needs, and advance the field's understanding of their disabilities.</p>
                <p>Most recently, I participated in the Toronto Metropolitan Thrill Design Invitational (previously Ryerson), which gave me the opportunity to design novel attractions, conceptualize new ride technologies, and solve complex safety issues. This opportunity also allowed me to present to top engineers and executives at Universal Creative and other companies in the attractions industry.</p>

                <h3>education</h3>
                <p>I am in my third year of completing my <b>Biomedical Engineering</b> bachelors degree with a minor in <b>Computer Science</b>. I am also simultaneously completing a masters degree in <b>Mechanical Engineering</b>, specializing in <i>Robotics</i> and <i>Engineering Management</i>. I expect to graduate with both degrees in June 2024. My masters project focuses on optimizing grip strength using a computational model of the wrist and hand to guide surgical decisionmaking and improve intervention techniques for patients with wrist osteoarthritis.</p>

                <p> My interest in engaging with new technologies has led me to pursue a career in intellectual property law and I am currently looking for opportunities to explore this field as a patent engineer/agent. I hope to attend law school in the future and work as an IP attorney, working with creators to foster innovation by protecting their novel inventions.</p>
                <p> I have a background across multiple fields, including biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science, and have led multiple projects that have investigated the intersections of these disciplines.  I recently competed in the Toronto Metropolitan Thrill Design Invitational (presented by Universal Creative) as the team leader, which gave me the opportunity to design novel attractions, conceptualize new ride technologies, and solve complex safety issues. This opportunity also allowed me to present to top engineers and executives at Universal Creative and other companies in the attractions industry. I look forward to competing again this coming year.</p>
                <p> This portfolio website was created entirely from scratch using HTML and CSS, without utilizing frameworks. Please contact me if you have any suggestions on how I may improve my designs or if you would like to learn more about my projects and experience.</p>
